## 🧠 Executive Summary

**GeoSense** is an autonomous geospatial diagnostic and anomaly interception framework designed to detect GNSS / GPS coordinate manipulation and hardware-level signal spoofing.

Typical security systems blindly trust location payloads. GeoSense bypasses this vulnerability by executing low-level spatiotemporal mathematical checks against real-world physical limits, protecting tracking data in real-time.

## 🚀 The Architecture: 2-Machine Production Sync

This project runs continuously on a dedicated, physical dual-node local infrastructure integrated with multi-cloud resources:

## 🛰️ The Data Pipeline Flow:

**Edge Ingestion**: Telemetry data is simulated via Android hardware nodes (Termux) and posted securely to a serverless gateway.

**Google Cloud Run API**: Serves as a secure API Proxy that processes requests and routes AI queries to Gemini-2.5-Flash (Vertex AI Platform) without exposing client-side API keys.

**Queueing & Lakehouse**: Streams live packets through Azure Event Hubs and directly into Microsoft Fabric Eventstream Delta Tables.

**Local Database Pour**: The python sync pipeline pulls the raw 76,135 spatiotemporal rows and bulk-injects them directly into my local Dockerized PostgreSQL/PostGIS database!

## 🕵️‍♂️ Case #250-KM: Impossible Physics Isolation

During a real-world spatiotemporal audit, GeoSense isolated a critical GPS spoofing attempt on an active vehicle:

**The Anomaly**: The vehicle coordinate points made an instantaneous 250 kilometer jump from an Abu Dhabi residential street directly into the offshore Ruwais oil sector.

**The Math**: The temporal gap between the pings was under 0.8 seconds, indicating an impossible physical velocity of 1,474 km/h.

**The Isolation**: By calculating the Euclidean distance delta and passing it through a Moving Average Buffer, the system automatically identified the signal as "COMPROMISED" and quarantined the payload.

## ⚙️ Core Stack & Technologies

**Languages**: Python, SQL, JavaScript (ES6+), Shell Scripting

**Databases**: PostgreSQL / PostGIS, SQL Server, Azure SQL

**Cloud & DevOps**: Google Cloud Run, Vertex AI Studio, Azure Event Hubs, Microsoft Fabric, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, Linux / Ubuntu Admin

**Frontend Graphics**: Three.js (3D WebGL), Tailwind CSS, Chart.js
